# peermesh

> Start a **fully meshed network** by passing on the generated link and share files **peer-to-peer** and **end-to-end encrypted** powered by WebRTC!

- [x] Works fully in the browser using `WebRTC`.
- [x] Mesh swarms can be started by opening the site. A "mesh URL" is generated to be passed around.
- [x] The mesh URL contains a password. All files mesh will be sent `end-to-end encrypted`.
- [x] Swarms can be joined by opening the mesh URL.
- [x] Swarm form fully meshed networks (n:n) using [`webrtc-swarm`](https://github.com/mafintosh/webrtc-swarm).
- [x] WebRTC signaling data is exchanged via [`signalhub`](https://github.com/mafintosh/signalhub).

Files will not be propagated among peers. The peers that initates a transfer will send the file to all connected peers.

  Peertransfer is a (1:n) WebRTC based file transfer tool. Compared to `peermesh` it encodes a authentication code into the "sharing URL" that is passed around and will not initiate WebRTC signaling if the code is missing or wrong.
